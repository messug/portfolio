To add your profile photo:

1. Place your professional photo in: /tmp/cc-agent/58552847/project/public/images/profile.jpg
2. The photo should be:
   - Professional headshot
   - Square aspect ratio (recommended)
   - High quality (at least 500x500px)
   - Clear background

The About section butterfly SVG can be replaced with your profile photo, or you can add it alongside the existing design.

For reference, look at line 33-77 in src/component/About/About.jsx where the SVG butterfly is currently displayed.
